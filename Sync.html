            <p>This Vulnlab box starts by exploiting an old protocol, rsync, which exposed a directory we could download. Inside, we discovered a user’s hashed password along with the method used to generate it. Using this information, we successfully cracked the hash and obtained valid credentials.</p>
            <p>With these credentials, we logged into an FTP server, which provided access to the user’s home directory. Notably, the user had read, write, and modify permissions, allowing us to create an SSH directory and upload our own public SSH key. This enabled us to log in as the user via SSH.</p>
            <p>Upon enumeration, we found two additional user accounts on the system. One of these users had reused the same password, allowing us to escalate access to the second account. we discovered multiple backup zip files, which we transferred to our local machine. Extracting the contents revealed both the shadow and passwd files, allowing us to crack additional password hashes using John the Ripper.</p>
            <p>With access to the final user, we identified a root-owned script that executed every minute or two. Since we had write permissions to this script, we modified it to include a reverse shell, successfully gaining root access and fully compromising the machine.</p>

            <h3>Rsync port 873</h3>
            <p>Rsync is utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and a storage drive and across networked computers by comparing the modification times and sizes of files. A default port is 873.</p>
            <p>We can view if there is any folders available for us to view.</p>

            <p>It shows us the username and their password hashes. Trying to crack with hashcat failed for both hashes. Viewing the <code>www</code> directory and outputting the contexts of index.php will show us how the hash is created. I will walk through this.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><code>$secure</code> – This acts as the <code>salt</code> in the hashing process.</li>
                <li><code>$hash</code> – The final hash is generated using <code>MD5</code>, which takes the combination of:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>md5($secure . $username . "|" . $password . "|")</code></li>
                    <li>Here, <code>|</code> (pipe character) is explicitly included in the hashing process.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h2>Understanding the Hash Format:</h2>
            <p>With this understanding, the stored hash follows the format: <code>hash:salt|username|</code></p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>hash</code> = The final MD5 output.</li>
                <li><code>salt</code> = The <code>$secure</code> value.</li>
                <li><code>username</code> = The username (which is also concatenated as part of the hashing process).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The reason we include the pipe <code>(`|`)</code> is because it was also part of the input string being hashed in <code>md5()</code>. This ensures that when cracking the hash with <code>Hashcat</code>, the format is correct.</p>
            <p>This is the format that hashcat also needs. With that being said we have the correct hash format for hashcat to crack</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the "Sync" challenge demonstrates how a series of misconfigurations—from an exposed rsync service and weak password hashing to SQL injection and insecure file permissions—can be chained together to fully compromise a system. This case underscores the importance of using up-to-date protocols, enforcing strong authentication, and maintaining strict control over critical scripts to prevent such cascading vulnerabilities.</p>
